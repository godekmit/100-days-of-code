# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time going for Lesson 12 from py4e, as well as some practice problems from earlier lessons.

**Thoughts**: I think that it'll be difficult to find some projects to create this early. I'm planning on spending more time reviewing the basics before moving onto additional lessons, and hopefully following the binance yt tutorials within the next month

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lesson 12 on py4e, and I found a couple websites so I could actually do practice problems

**Thoughts**: It's been a couple weeks from the first day, but I still want to keep progressing
