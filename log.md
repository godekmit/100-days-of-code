# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time going for Lesson 12 from py4e, as well as some practice problems from earlier lessons.

**Thoughts**: I think that it'll be difficult to find some projects to create this early. I'm planning on spending more time reviewing the basics before moving onto additional lessons, and hopefully following the binance yt tutorials within the next month

### Day 1: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lesson 12 on py4e, and I found a couple websites so I could actually do practice problems

**Thoughts**: It's been a couple weeks from the first day, but I still want to keep progressing

### Day 2: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 15 practice problems from w3resource, although they weren't super hard ones.

**Thoughts**: I think that tomorrow I should find more challenging problems, so that I can learn lists, dicts, tuples, functions, etc.

### Day 3: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent some more time working through practice problems, with a focus on the collections: tuples, dicts, lists. Found out that w3resource has a shit ton of practice problems.

**Thoughts**: I think that I made some steps in the right direction, and I think that I can reach 100 days.

### Day 4: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: w3resource list problems, today I had a busy schedule so I was only to work for about 40 minutes. I wish I spent time over the weekend coding.

**Thoughts**: I think I need to try harder to keeping a strict schedule, because I skipped 4 days of programming.

### Day 5: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned a new way to run through for loops, for index, value in item:..... I also learned how to place "flags" in for loops with if statements, in order to check if something happened/did not happen. 

**Thoughts**: 2 days in a row!

### Day 6: January 26, 2022
