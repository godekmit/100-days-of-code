### Day 1: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lesson 12 on py4e, and I found a couple websites so I could actually do practice problems

**Thoughts**: It's been a couple weeks from the first day, but I still want to keep progressing

**Link to work**: codebat, w3resource.com, hackerrank

### Day 2: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 15 practice problems from w3resource, although they weren't super hard ones.

**Thoughts**: I think that tomorrow I should find more challenging problems, so that I can learn lists, dicts, tuples, functions, etc.

### Day 3: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent some more time working through practice problems, with a focus on the collections: tuples, dicts, lists. Found out that w3resource has a shit ton of practice problems.

**Thoughts**: I think that I made some steps in the right direction, and I think that I can reach 100 days.

### Day 4: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: w3resource list problems, today I had a busy schedule so I was only to work for about 40 minutes. I wish I spent time over the weekend coding.

**Thoughts**: I think I need to try harder to keeping a strict schedule, because I skipped 4 days of programming.
